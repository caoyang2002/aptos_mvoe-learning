Please note that the translation provided is a direct translation of the text. Some terms, like "mnt" in "NFT mnt contract," may not have a direct translation or may be specific to a certain context or technology. If "mnt" is an acronym or specific term used in the technology or project, it may be best to leave it untranslated or replaced with the appropriate term in English. Additionally, the translation of markdown links (e.g., `#一创建一个-nft`) may not be accurate without knowing the context or the intended URL structure. It's also important to maintain the markdown syntax for links to function correctly in the translated document.
